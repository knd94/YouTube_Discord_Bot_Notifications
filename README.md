# Discord Bot Notifications

# Read through ALL of this

All the stuff with "YOUR_" will be **your** credentials. 

You will need to:
1. Go your Discord Application Settings,
2. Go to your app, 
3. At the left hand side, there is a Bot option, click it(like so: ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/97dcf8b3-3407-470a-82c1-85610875b564) ) 

4. Make **SURE, POSITIVE** that it looks like this (On Dark Mode):![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8cf84351-c513-4b12-aead-db105c508e24)
5. Download the .py and edit it!
6. Run it!

Terminal Prompts: 
pip install aiohttp feedparser discord.py playwright

python -m playwright install

pip install discord.py

pip install discord.py google-api-python-client

And you're done! Have fun with it. TikToks and YouTube videos will update every 5 minutes with this code. 

I really wanted to do this for free. I don't want people to pay for Discord Bots. Nor do I want people's Bot Token to be breached. With this, you can edit everything if you want. 

Companies that offer payment to use the Discord bot, I think, aren't very good. But that's just me. 

It is with Python, so everybody can download and run the file.
