# YouTube Discord Bot Notifications

All the stuff with "YOUR_" will be **your** credentials. 

You will need to:
1. Go your Discord Application Settings,
2. Go to your app, 
3. At the left hand side, there is a Bot option, click it(like so: ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/97dcf8b3-3407-470a-82c1-85610875b564) ) 

4. Make **SURE, POSITIVE** that it looks like this (On Dark Mode):![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8cf84351-c513-4b12-aead-db105c508e24)
5. Download the .py and edit it!
6. Run it! It'll most likely post your latest video up on your server though. 

If you don't pip install discord.py or pip install discord.py google-api-python-client , it will not work. 

Like I said in the description, I'm looking for a TikTok notification system on Discord too. As well as that, I will look into a livestream notification feature too.
